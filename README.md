# CarRobotics
Contains my coding trials for car control using IR, Ultrasonic sensors and line tracking

- This was built for the 4 wheel car that can be purchased online with 2 motors and i have attached some additional sensors to the car as well in some of my experiements

# Threee different examples so far:
- One control the car movement using IR
- One control the car movement using IR but with smart ultrasonic sensor for obstacle avoidance
- One control the car movement using IR and line tracking but with also smart ultasonice sensor for obstacle avoidance

You can get the car for example:
